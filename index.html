                        Hello Y'all! My name is Stephanie Gonzales. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas; (south Austin to be specific, before living in south Austin was cool). I graduated from UT-Austin in 2010 and 2013 with a degree in English Literature and a degree in Biology (respectively). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked in the medical field for 7 years and now I am interested in transitioning into the tech industry. I am currently enrolled in the full stack website design program at UT-Austin. This website is serving as my first assignment in the course. Please enjoy my page!
